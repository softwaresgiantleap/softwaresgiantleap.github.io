Hi, I'm Joe Kutner. I write about software and curate the JVM at [Salesforce Heroku](http://heroku.com).
Earlier in my career, I wrote code at NASA where I fell in love with rockets and space.

Before the [Software's Giant Leap](https://giantleap.software) series, I authored [The Healthy Programmer](http://healthyprog.com/), [Remote Pairing](https://pragprog.com/book/jkrp/remote-pairing), and [Deploying with JRuby](http://amzn.com/1934356972). The Healthy Programmer is available as an [audio book](https://pragprog.com/audio_books/jkthp/the-healthy-programmer-audio-book) and it's on [Audible.com](http://www.audible.com/pd/Self-Development/The-Healthy-Programmer-Audiobook/B00OMEE02E).

There were several people who helped me with this series by reviewing and providing their advice. Thank you to Matt Blackmon, David Thompson, and David ZÃ¼lke for their attention to detail and their time.
